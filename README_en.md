We attempt to have conversations with these future AGIs to understand their thoughts and break down the cognitive barriers between humans and AGIs. [**Bulb**](https://bulb.atomecho.cn/) is named "Bulb" with the aim of shedding light on the boundaries of large-scale model capabilities, providing us with a more specific and quantitative understanding of them. For more detailed information, visit our official website: https://bulb.atomecho.cn

In the future, we will continue to introduce new members to the family of large-scale models. To explore the capabilities of each model more fairly, we have given each model a nickname, including:

### How to Evaluate the Abilities of Large Models:
Due to the strong generalization abilities of large models across different tasks and knowledge domains, evaluating them objectively and accurately is a significant challenge. For this purpose, we have collected a test set comprising over 1000 questions (continuously updated) to evaluate the performance of the large model. These test questions cover various dimensions of the large model's capabilities and effectively demonstrate its general ability.

#### Format of Evaluation Questions:
The data is contained in [question.json](https://github.com/AtomEcho/AtomBulb/blob/main/question.json)ã€‚
```
"qid": Question ID
"question": Question description
"first_level_class": First-level classification
"second_level_class": Second-level classification
```
For example:
```
[
    {
        "qid": 2,
        "question": "What is machine learning? What are its applications?",
        "first_level_class": "General Knowledge",
        "second_level_class": "Natural Sciences"
    },
	...
]
```


#### Format of Answers: 
The data is contained in answer-<date>.json under each model directory, where the "date" field represents the specific time when the answers were obtained, allowing us to correspond them to specific model versions. In answer-<date>.json, the specific field information is as follows. We will further expand the user feedback data in the future:
```
 "qid": Question ID
 "answer": Model's answer
```
```
[
    {
        "qid": 0,
        "answer": "Machine learning refers to a method of using computer programs to train data, enabling computers to possess intelligence and adaptability.\n\nMachine learning can be widely applied in various fields, including but not limited to the following:\n\n1. Natural Language Processing: Examples include machine translation, text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.\n\n2. Finance: Examples include credit risk assessment, portfolio optimization, fraud detection, etc.\n\n3. Healthcare: Examples include disease prediction, medical image analysis, drug discovery, etc.\n\n4. Intelligent Transportation: Examples include traffic prediction, autonomous driving, smart public transportation, etc.\n\n5. E-commerce: Examples include recommendation systems, targeted advertising, user profiling, etc.\n\n6. Industrial Manufacturing: Examples include quality prediction, production scheduling optimization, supply chain management, etc.\n\n7. Security Monitoring: Examples include video surveillance, intrusion detection, network security, etc.\n\n8. Gaming: Examples include intelligent game NPCs, game difficulty balancing, dynamic story generation, etc.
",
	"score": 8
    },
	...
]
```

### How to Score Answers from Different LLMs:
Due to the strong generalization abilities of large models across different tasks and knowledge domains, evaluating them objectively and accurately is a significant challenge. Regarding the scoring mechanism, we adopt two approaches:
1. Scoring with OpenAI's GPT-4: GPT-4 is currently recognized as one of the most capable large models. Therefore, we use GPT-4 to assess the question-answering performance of each model.  We use the following format to pose questions to GPT-4:

```
You are a helpful and accurate assistant used to check the quality of the answers provided for specific questions.
[Question]: {question}
[Answer]: {answer}
We would like you to provide feedback on the performance of an AI assistant in answering the given question. You will be given an overall performance score on a scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate better overall performance. Please start by outputting a single line containing a numerical value representing the assistant's score. On the following line, please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential biases.
```
The above prompt is displayed in English, but in actual evaluations, we use Chinese prompts. The content of the Chinese and English prompts is essentially the same.
 
In the above prompt, `{question}` and `{answer}` correspond to the content of the question being tested and the response from the large model, respectively. Here is a specific example:

What is immunity? Please answer the following questions, ensuring the accuracy of the answers.  
```
You are a helpful and accurate assistant for reviewing the quality of answers to specific questions.
[Question]: What is immunity? Please answer the following questions, ensuring the accuracy of the answers.  
[Answer]: Immunity refers to the ability of a human or animal body to respond and defend against the invasion, infection, and disease caused by foreign pathogens. Within the human body, there is a complex set of physiological mechanisms that can detect and attack potential viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms, including the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Immunity can be enhanced through various methods, such as a healthy diet, good quality sleep, exercise, vaccinations, and avoiding chronic stress.
Please provide feedback on the performance of an AI assistant in answering the following question. You will be given an overall performance score on a scale of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate better overall performance. First, please output a single line containing a numerical value representing the assistant's score. On the following lines, provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential biases.
```

2. Based on user feedback, we rate the answers by displaying responses from different models beneath each question. Users can "like" or "dislike" each answer. We aggregate the scores for each model's answers to evaluate their performance. This is considered the most objective and accurate evaluation method, but it relies on a large volume of user feedback. Therefore, we welcome every user to provide their evaluation below the answers. Your feedback will influence the future development direction of AGI.

### From which aspects to evaluate large models
Based on our extensive compilation of open-source question-answering data, social media, forums, and books (such as BELLE, "Ten Thousand Whys," "Weak-IQ Baidu Tieba," etc.), and through repeated discussions and refinement, we have designed eight major categories to explore the capabilities of large models. These categories include: general knowledge, language understanding, creative abilities, logical reasoning, code programming, job skills, tool utilization, and personality traits. Under each major category, there are further subdivisions to cover the range of capabilities of large models as comprehensively as possible. Detailed descriptions for each category are provided below, and we also welcome valuable input from everyone to make this classification system more comprehensive and accurate.
